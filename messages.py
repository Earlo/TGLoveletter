LORE = """The guard looked Bartolemew Kaiss up and down for a moment and then frowned. “I’m sorry, Master Kaiss, but the princess is not seeing visitors at this time. She is, of course, in despair over the arrest of her mother.” “Of course,” the young composer said, nodding and looking appropriately sympathetic. “But I am not just visiting, you see. Her Highness requested my instruction. We are to practice her singing.” “The princess already has a vocal maestro,” the gruff woman replied, raising an eyebrow. “I’m sure he knows that, Odette,” said a kind voice echoing down the hall that connected the residence to the palace. The two turned to see Susannah, one of Princess Annette’s handmaids, walking toward them. “What the good composer means to say is that Annette requested his work for their practice.” The young woman smiled at the guard and gave Bartolemew a conspiratorial wink. From his satchel, Bartolemew produced a sealed tube. “If you will be so kind as to deliver these sheets of music, my dear Susannah,” he said with a smile and a genteel nod. The guard took the tube from him, but as it changed hands, something with a little weight shifted inside the tube. “What’s this, then?” the guard asked, jostling it next to her ear. Certainly not a small statue of a bird the Princess is so fond of, Bartolemew thought. “The… quill and ink I used to pen the music, in case she or the maestro wish to make any changes. I always deliver some with a new composition.” Susannah gently took the case from the suspicious guard. “Oh, would you stop, Odette? It’s just some music,” she chided playfully. “I’ll see to it that milady gets these,” she added with a hand on Bartolemew’s arm. “I’m sure she’ll be eager to see the contents.”
